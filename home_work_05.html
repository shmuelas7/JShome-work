            You shout it out
            But I can't hear a word you say
            I'm talking loud not saying much
            I'm criticized but all your bullets ricochet
            You shoot me down, but I get up
            I'm bulletproof nothing to lose
            Fire away, fire away
            Ricochet, you take your aim
            Fire away, fire away
            You shoot me down but I won't fall, I am titanium
            You shoot me down but I won't fall
            I am titanium, I am titanium, I am titanium, I am titanium
            Cut me down
            But it's you who has further to fall
            Ghost town, haunted love
            Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones
            I'm talking loud not saying much
            I'm bulletproof nothing to lose
            Fire away, fire away
            Ricochet, you take your aim
            Fire away, fire away
            You shoot me down but I won't fall
            I am titanium
            You shoot me down but I won't fall
            I am titanium, I am titanium
            Stone-hard, machine gun
            Firing at the ones who run
            Stone-hard, thus bulletproof glass
            You shoot me down but I won't fall, I am titanium
            You shoot me down but I won't fall, I am titanium
            You shoot me down but I won't fall, I am titanium
            You shoot me down but I won't fall, I am titanium
